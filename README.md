# Slider-InfoshareAcademy-Task

# In the first case, the exam task.

What I had to do:

Use the "fetch" function and download information about photos and describes, then:
- view all
- display only one

Create navigation buttons:
- to select the previous and next photo
- when it comes to the end the button should be deactivated
- create buttons with numbers so that each number corresponds to a specific photo

Implement an interval every 3 seconds for the next photo

Stopping the interval when you click any button
